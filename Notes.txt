Bug:

If field has same name as register, we get errors
Need to add field qualifier to struct

Features:
- readable, writable should default to false and be specified true if valid
- Endianness per register should be allowed- icm42670p, my first real peripheral, has an example
  of register breaknig endianness convention (APEX_DATA4, APEX_DATA5)
